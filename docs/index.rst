**Requests III** is an HTTP library for Python, built for Humans and Machines, alike. This repository is a work in progress, and the expected release timeline is "before PyCon 2020".

-------------------

Behold, the power of Requests III::

    >>> from requests import HTTPSession

    # Make a connection pool.
    >>> http = HTTPSession()

    # Make a request.
    >>> r = http.request('get', 'https://httpbin.org/ip')

    # View response data.
    >>> r.json()
    {'ip': '172.69.48.124'}

Requests III allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* **HTTP/1.1** & **HTTP/2** (wip) requests,
without the need for manual thought-labor. There's no need to add query
strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and
HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, as well.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over ~1.6 million
installations *per day*! Join the party!

User Testimonials
-----------------

**Microsoft**, **Google**, **Amazon**, **Salesforce**, **Heroku**, **DigitalOcean**, **RedHat**, **Twitter**, **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **Spotify**, *&c* all use **Requests** to query internal HTTPS services.

**Armin Ronacher**, creator of Flaskâ€”
    *Requests is the perfect example how beautiful an API can be with the
    right level of abstraction.*

**Matt DeBoard**â€”
    *I'm going to get Kenneth Reitz's Python requests module tattooed
    on my body, somehow. The whole thing.*

**Daniel Greenfeld**â€”
    *Nuked a 1200 LOC spaghetti code library with 10 lines of code thanks to
    Kenneth Reitz's Requests library. Today has been AWESOME.*

**Kenny Meyers**â€”
    *Python HTTP: When in doubt, or when not in doubt, use Requests. Beautiful,
    simple, Pythonic.*

If your organization uses Requests internally, consider `supporting the development of 3.0 <https://cash.me/$KennethReitz>`_.
